"""Generate the known-answer vectors for pith-inflate.

Every expected plaintext in the generated file comes from Python's zlib, which
is an implementation this workspace does not contain. Round-tripping the crate
against itself would prove nothing; round-tripping against zlib proves the
decoder agrees with an independent one.

Regenerate with:

    python gen_vectors.py

and commit the result together with the regeneration. The output is
deterministic: the only randomness is a seeded PRNG.

The generator also records, for each vector, which DEFLATE block type it
actually exercises - read from the stream itself, not assumed from the
compression level - so the suite can assert that all three block types are
covered instead of hoping they are.
