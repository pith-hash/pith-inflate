"""Build backend glue for the pith-inflate ctypes wheel.

The wheel carries the Rust cdylib built by ``cargo build --release``:
``PITH_CDYLIB_DIR`` (default ``target/release`` at the repository root)
is scanned for the cdylib and copied into the wheel by a ``build_py``
hook. ``BinaryDistribution`` marks the distribution non-pure so the
wheel is tagged per platform, and ``bdist_wheel_py3_none`` narrows the tag
to ``py3-none-<platform>`` — the CD matrix builds one wheel per platform
and publish-pypi uploads them together.
